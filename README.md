# webscrapping
This is where I store my various webscrapping projects  
1. shipxy_shipinfo_by_mmsi: In this mini project, I am using the HTTP protocol to perform web-scraping on the response forms from shipxy.com. I gather additional ship data via MMSI and save it locally in an Excel file. I've also included the frequency of communication to test the response efficiency of shipxy.com.
